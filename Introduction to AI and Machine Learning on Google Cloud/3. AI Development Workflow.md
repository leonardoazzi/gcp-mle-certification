# ML Workflow
- Data preparation
	- Upload data
	- Engineer features
- Model development
	- Train and evaluate the model
- Model serving
	- Deploy
	- Monitor the model

# Data preparation
- Data upload: objetives
	- Image
		- Classification (single or multi-label)
		- Object detection
		- Segmentation
	- Tabular
		- Regression/classification
		- Forecasting
	- Text data
		- Text classification
		- Entity extraction
		- sentiment analysis
	- Video data
		- Action recog
		- Video classification
		- Video object tracking
	- Multi-modal
- Data preparation
	- Feature engineering
		- Factor that contributes to prediction
		- Independent variable
		- VertexAI Feature Store
			- Manage, serve and share features
			- Shareable, reusable, scalable and easy to use
			- GenAI: manage and serve embeddings, retrieving similar items
			- Flow
				- Prepare data in bigquery
				- Register the data source
				- Connect to data source
				- Serve latest features

# Model development
- Evaluation
	- Confusion matrix
		- Recall (% actual): de todos os casos de fato positivos, quantos foram preditos como positivos
			- TP / TP+FN
		- Precision: de todos os casos preditos como positivos, quantos são de fato positivos
			- TP / TP + FP
		- Precision-recall curve
	- Feature importance
		- Vertex AI - Explainable AI (Learn more)

# Model serving
- Deploy model
	- Endpoint
		- Real time predictions (online)
		- Low latency
		- ex. instant recomendations
	- Batch prediction
		- No immediate response required
		- ex. e-mail recommendations
- Model monitoring
	- Vertex AI Pipelines
		- Automate, monitor, govern

# MLOps and workflow automation
- Workflow for ci/cd/ct (continuous training)
	- MLOps
		- ML
			- Upload data
			- Engineer feature
			- Train model
			- Evaluate result
		- Ops
			- Deploy
			- Monitor
			- Release
		- Para construir sistemas integrados de ML em produção
	- VertexAI Pipelines
		- Kubeflow pipelines (KFP)
			- Not tensorflow code
		- Tensorflow Extended (TFX)
			- Tensorflow code
			- Turn code into ML pipe
	- Ambientes
		- Experimentation / development / test environment
			- Data prep
			- Model dev
			- Trained model -> model registry
		- Staging / pre-production/ production environment
			- Model serving
	- Components
		- Custom components in the workflow
		- Pre-built components on Google Cloud

	- Phases of ML automation
		- Phase 0
			- GUI-based workflow
			- AutoML
			- E2E workflow before automation
		- Phase 1
			- Building components with Pipelines SDK
			- ex. training pipeline
		- Phase 2
			- Integrate components to form a pipeline

- Build a pipeline
	- Plan pipeline components
		- Custom / pre-built
		- Single responsability
	- Build custom components
	- Add prebuilt components
- Run a pipeline
	- Compile the pipeline
		- compiler.Compiler().compile()
	- Define and run the pipeline job

- Pipeline templates
